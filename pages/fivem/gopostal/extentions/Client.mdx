# Extentions
Our script provides a way to extend the functionality of the script. This can be done by editing the `ext.lua` file in the `client` or `server` folder with the following code snippet:

## Truck Spawned
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:GoPostal:Extention:TruckSpawned', function(entity)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

- entity: `number` (the entity of the truck)
