# Extentions
Our script provides a way to extend the functionality of the script. This can be done by editing the `ext.lua` file in the `client` or `server` folder with the following code snippet:

## Job Finished
```lua
AddEventHandler("Trusted:GoPostal:Extention:JobFinished", function(xPlayer, reward)
    ---@add extention code here.
end)
```

- xPlayer: `table` (the player object)
- reward: `number` (the reward amount)
